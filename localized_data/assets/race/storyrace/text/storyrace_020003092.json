    "The 2nd popular Biwa Hayahide, is running smoothly from the \\noutside and is chasing the first group.",
    "As expected of Hayahide, she already \\ncame this far! It's a good start",
    "But, I'm running my own run too…!",
    "……",
    "Each Horse Girl went around the 2nd corner \\nand entered the front of the other side.",
    "Winning Ticket is in the middle of the group, Narita Taishin is \\nin the 2nd position from the rear.",
    "Taishin just like in the “Yayoi Prize” she is coming from behind",
    "But, the one running in front is Hayahide, she is not an opponent \\nwho you can easily catch up to.",
    "That's why, I will from here!!",
    "Here, Winning Ticket has increased her pace!!",
    "More forward! Aim for 1st～～～!",
    "You are already here…! But, I won't let you off that easily!",
    "Waaaah～～!!",
    "Biwa Hayahide increased her pace! Number 1 and 2 in popularity is \\nlining up and is going around the last corner!",
    "Let it all out at once～～!!",
    "Why…!? Why do Hayahide have so much power left, even after she \\nflew right after at the start!?",
    "Huh!?",
    "Oops! The one running up here from the outside at onceー Narita \\nTaishin! It's Narita Taishin!!",
    "Waaaaaa～～!!!!",
    "No way!? You can't catch up with me from behind like that!!",
    "Eh!? I have to win! The Derby is already in front of me!!",
    "Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!",
    "It's Narita Taishin! Narita Taishin is the first to cross the \\nline!! The winner of the “SatsukiShou” is Narita Taishin!!",
    "In second place is Biwa Hayahide! The number \\n1 favorite Winning Ticket lost!",
    "I lost… I couldn't even catch up to either Taishin or Hayahide…",
    "I tried with all my strength… I gave \\nit my all… Next is… the Derby…"
