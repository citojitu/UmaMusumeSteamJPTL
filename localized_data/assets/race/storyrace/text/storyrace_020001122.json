    "Following the success of Oguri Cap last year, these\\nyoung stars will be competing in the Arima Kinen\\nin order to forge their own legends.",
    "Who will cross the finish line in first place? Will it be the\\nmost likely to win, Mejiro McQueen? Or will one of her rivals?",
    "As if cutting through the cheers, the Uma Musume are quickly\\ngoing past the stands with all their might!",
    "Your cheers… and your support, they will\\nallow me to push forward once again.",
    "You're incredible today, McQueen. It's just like the Spring Tenno\\nSho… no, even greater than that.",
    "The issue before was not my running style… It was\\nsimply an issue of immense expectations.",
    "The Uma Musume are rounding the fourth corner and heading into\\nthe final stretch! The title of Grand Prix Uma Musume is right\\nbefore their eyes! All that's left is 300 meters!",
    "But now that we are all on the same wavelength\\nI know that I can do it!",
    "Mejiro McQueen begins her final spurt! The distance between her\\nand the lead is closing rapidly!",
    "Third, second! Will Mejiro McQueen be crowned\\nthe strongest active Uma Musume!?",
    "Oh, there's someone else coming from behind with incredible\\nacceleration! What's going to happen!? Neither of them are\\nbacking down! So who will win!?",
    "Yaaah!!"
